It's more leadership-related and it takes a lot more initiative. I spend the bulk of my time completing schoolwork and keeping up with extracurriculars, which in turn means that I have less time for my other interests. However, I have found that with the full lockdown, I get some of this time back because school cools down a little. I'm able to film and edit small projects or draw just for fun. ","As someone who doesn't enjoy an abundance of social interaction, I, selfishly, found lockdown very easy and rewarding at the beginning. I never missed others, my grades were thriving, my mental health was at an all-time high. However, when summer came and restrictions eased up, I was able to meet my friends (with masks, gloves, sanitizer, distancing, etc.) and gain back some of the social interaction that I lost. This was until Halloween, which was when things started quickly deteriorating. We weren't meeting anymore to keep ourselves and our immunocompromised family members safe; back at square one. I think having that minimal sense of normalcy triggered something because I've started desperately wanting it back. I want to see my friends, have picnics, all the normal teenage things I've suddenly realized I don't and won't have. Very strange, but super new and different from the rest of lockdown. ","On the one hand, I feel so unhappy and cheated to lose the experiences I so desperately long for: dances, assemblies, spirit weeks, club meetings, etc. I wonder whether I'll ever get those experiences that you remember for the rest of your life, even the bad prom dresses and horrible dance songs. However, I'm also appreciative of my family members' good health and the quality time that I get with my immediate family. I'll be gone at university at some point, so being able to spend time with my dog and my parents is a privilege. It's a balance of both, which is what I've learned from my privileged lockdown experience.

",For high school students culminating were due last week so it was definitely higher stress then usual.  ,There is definitely a feeling of disconnect. I am an extrovert and love being out with people but in the pandemic I have no social battery. Answering texts has become a chore so much so that I often avoid my friends and family and just want to be alone and wait all this out. It can be lonely and suffocating to be receiving messages and not be able to answer them. Generally I have just become much lazier and less motivated.

Iäó»ve always been proud of him and what he does, but since the pandemic, Iäó»ve appreciate what he does more and how hard he works. Due to the new COVID-19 protocols, he has to wear lots of PPE on top of the regular greens that he wears on top of his clothes. This PPE includes, extra pairs of gloves, an N-95 mask and a face shield on top of it, an extra gown, boot and neck covers. When he does extensive cases such as open heart for example, he has to wear all of these extra layers for up to 12 hours at a time. I can only imagine how hot he must get. When he comes home after a long shift, I try my best to be on good behaviour and help my mom make a meal so that he can eat and relax. He never complains about his job even if he had a hard day and I am really thankful for everything that he does for me and my family. Since covid-19 started, I now feel a little more worried when he leaves to work, because I know that he deals with patients who have it and I really donäó»t want him to get it and become ill. Iäó»m sure that lots of other family how either are or have frontline workers in their household feel the same and I appreciate everything they do.
